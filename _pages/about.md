I am a Ph.D. student at the Xi'an Jiaotong University ([XJTU](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)) under the supervision of [Prof. Nanning Zheng](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/nnzheng).
I received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University.
My research interests mainly include **place recognition** and **autonomous vehicle localization**.
I have published several papers in CVPR, RA-L, ICRA, IROS, and so on. I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Assoc. Prof. Sanping Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Drvv44AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Assis. Prof. Shitao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l5bgTfwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), and [Assoc. Prof. Zhixiong Nan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Kb5wWwoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I am happy to learn and progress together with our Pioneer team members.

I am lucky to have opportunities to work at Robotic Systems Lab ([RSL](https://rsl.ethz.ch/)) as a visiting student (Dec. 2023-Dec. 2024). That's what I'd like to call destiny. RSL family members are sooo nice.
